## Kids Class

Our kids program is designed to help kids build a strong foundation for basic JIU JITSU working extensively on overviewing the positions and situations in JIU JITSU.

We also focus on bully-proofing children. Kids will be taught how to defend themselves using both verbal and real life jiu jitsu techniques. Jiu Jitsu is an effective tool to help kids overcome bullies using leverage and control, instead of kicking or punching.

This program will help kids build confidence, learn self-discipline, develop respect for the instructors and peers and improve coordination, agility, and focus.

Monday and Wednesday (5 years old to 10 years old)
4:30 pm to 5:15 pm

Tuesday and Thursday (11 years old to 15 years old)
6:15 pm to 7:00 pm
