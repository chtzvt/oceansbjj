Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger, heavier assailant by using proper technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground, and then applying joint-locks and choke holds to defeat the opponent.

In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you will learn the skills of taking an opponent to the ground, controlling one’s opponent, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks or chokeholds.

No matter what your belt or level of ability, there is always room for growth in jiujitsu. There are so many new and interesting techniques, training methods and perspectives that boredom should never be an issue for long – We’ll help you keep searching and growing.

The fact that Brazilian jiu-jitsu will change your body cannot be denied. You can physically see your body changing with every day or week. What you can’t see is the improvements in your overall health as a result of training.
