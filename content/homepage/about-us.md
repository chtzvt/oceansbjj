### Professor Leandro Massaro

My name is Leandro Massaro, 46 years old, fitness coach, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black-belt under legendary Wellington “Megaton” Dias. I have been married since 2008, and I’m the proud dad of an amazing 11 year old little girl.

I have been a dedicated Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu student, practitioner, and athlete since 2000; earning medals in some of Jiu-Jitsu’s most prominent tournaments, including: Masters World Championship, American Nationals, Pan-American Championship, Arizona State, and Asian Open Championship.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has always played a crucial role in my life; it has literally helped me become what I am today; it to pushed me to get out of my comfort zone and shaped me into a better version of myself; someone healthier, happier, and more confident.

I’m a firm believer that hard work, dedication, honesty, and integrity are the pillars for success. Over the past 21 years, Jiu-Jitsu has helped me forge friendships that will last a lifetime. I have had the privilege of working, training, and competing with some of the best in the sport.

- 2011 IBJJF No-Gi World Tournament in California as a Brown Belt (Master Division).
